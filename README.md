Lead Mentor: Bill from Pushpay
App Name: DoubleKnot
Team DoubleKnot addressed the problem that friends and family of tourists/trampers are not always aware that they are missing on a trek before it is too late.  Before a user embarks on one of New Zealand’s popular Great Walks, they can use the DoubleKnot webapp to notify Facebook friends of their departure. It requests Facebook verification and asks permission to post on the user’s behalf.

It helps the user make an informed estimate about how long the trek should take them, by displaying stats from the Department of Conservation, including track name, length, location, difficulty, type, and average walk time. It also incorporates the Open Weather Map API to display results from a dataset holding current weather for the Great Walk locations.

When the user has chosen an estimated walk time they press Go and it posts to their Facebook wall informing their friends of the beginning of their trek. If they have not checked out within their estimated time the app posts again on their behalf prompting their Facebook friends to try contact them or escalate the matter if need-be.

The Nitty Gritty: DoubleKnot made use of the Facebook API, Open Weather Map API and Dataset, and Department of Conservation Dataset. For collaboration our team used Git and Slack. The frontend used HTML, CSS, and Javascript – and the backend used Express, a Node.js framework.
